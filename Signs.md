## Signage
One of my hobbies is signage and signage systems. As such, I create "real fake signs" to see if I can make existing signs look better. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Here are some examples of things I've done. Not all of them are final products, and they are all rough (I'm not a graphic designer), but I like to think they're a good indicator of what things could look like. 

[TOC]
***
### York 

- [York Outdoor Sign](Downloads/York Outdoor Sign.pdf)
	- York's signs aren't great in high-traffic outdoor or overhead applications, and people like to know where they are, so I designed this prototype. 
- [Storage Sign](Downloads/Storage Sign.pdf)
	- Storage of open foods in clubrooms is prohibited. (They are small.) This is another example of a "pseudo-York" sign. 
- [Sign for Steacie Basement](Downloads/Sign for Steacie Basement.pdf)
	- Sign for the base of the stairs near Petrie in Steacie to guide people through the tunnels at [York](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/steacie/). This is an example of a real fake York sign. (Also, I did read York's signage manuals, inside and out, because I'm a nerd.) 
	- *If you look closely, you'll see this sign uses the wrong font: it's in Franklin Gothic Book, which is close, but not quite right (especially the "1")*.
	
### TTC
- [**Yorkdale** Sign](Downloads/YORKDALE Sign.pdf)
	- Updated signs for **Yorkdale** also to relieve confusion that the *mall exit is only at one end of the platform*. 
	- Includes tiles for other stations, and improved (labelled) over-door signage at the end. 
	- [Condensed Version](Downloads/YORKDALE.pdf)
- [**Union** Streetcar Signs](Downloads/Union Streetcar Sign.pdf)
	- **Union** streetcar signs as people get confused knowing what streetcar to get for the ferries (any streetcar) and how to find the streetcar platform (it's at the back of the Yonge Line platform). 
- [**Sheppard West** Sign](Downloads/SHEPPARD WEST Sign.pdf)
	- Updated overhead sign for **Sheppard West** (_formerly_ **Downsview**), as **Downsview** used to have retro-future overhead directional signs that were covered up for the TYSSE as they were now wrong. 
- [**St. Clair** Signs](Downloads/ST CLAIR Signs.pdf)
	- Improvement to signs at **St. Clair West** to make exits more obvious. 
- [**Sheppard-Yonge** Signs](Downloads/SHEPPARD-YONGE Signs.pdf)
	- Better signs for **Sheppard-Yonge** that won't leave you hanging if you're looking for the buses. Includes map (as this is the only way to design coherent signage). Not complete, and I'm not satisfied with my implementation of Line 4 signage on the Yonge platform. I think it should only be at the base of stairwells and escalators. 
- [**North York Centre** Signs](Downloads/NORTH YORK CENTRE.pdf)
	- How to make the signs at **North York Centre** up to spec. Includes map. 
- [Sheppard Signs](Downloads/Sheppard Signs.pdf)
	- Signs to improve Line 4[^4]. 

### Other
- [GO Sign](Downloads/GO Sign.pdf) 
	- An example of what directional signs on GO platforms could look like (in the style of the subway directional signs). This is useful for stations on the [LE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeshore_East_line) line, where riders just want to take the first train to Toronto. Now they know. 
- [Toronto Street Sign](Downloads/Toronto Street Sign.pdf)
	- Steeles $^\mathsf{Av}$W traffic signal street sign. More-or-less the correct font (Clearview – although I think Toronto condenses theirs for some reason) and colour.

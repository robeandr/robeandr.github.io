[Oshawa](https://www.oshawa.ca/business-and-investment/discover-downtown.asp?_mid_=690) is the city in Durham (regardless of what [Pickering](pickering.html) has to say). Its downtown is completely unlike any other in Durham Region. It is completely urban. 

Oshawa was founded as a mill town ([surprise](../DTT.html#Durham)!) at the foot of what is now [Simcoe St](https://goo.gl/maps/rBWh5Xj6oUgKj8Ex8). Oshawa has been known for many things in its time, such as [Sir John A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Macdonald)'s supposed favourite pub between Toronto and Kingston, but is really known for [GM](https://www.gm.ca). Originally started as the M<sup>c</sup>Laughlin Motor Car C^<u>o</u> by Colonel Samuel M<sup>c</sup>Laughlin, this grew to become the largest car company in Canada. It was later bought by GM and Col. Sam became the president of GM Canada. GM's [Canadian headquarters](https://goo.gl/maps/GUbwj2BYMeMvmuhC9) are still in Oshawa today. 

The [GM plant](https://goo.gl/maps/m3BEsUj46dNzhAjr6) was huge and basically built Oshawa to what it is today. My grandfather and uncle were both once employed by them. However, unfortunately GM has mostly left, and the vast GM lands scattered around Oshawa now lie vacant or occupied by [Costco](https://goo.gl/maps/SGUJTKu6a3QTkoNB9). As such, Oshawa is attempting to reinvent themselves as a university town. Oshawa is currently home to [Ontario Tech University (née UOIT)](https://ontariotechu.ca), a [Durham College](https://durhamcollege.ca) campus, and a [Trent University](https://www.trentu.ca/durham-gta) campus. It's working pretty well, but there's still a way to go. 

## Downtown

# Parkwood
In between running GM and giving toy cars to my uncles, 

Many things in Oshawa are named after Col. Sam (or his wife, Adelaide) today as a thanks for his help in building them, including [M<sup>c</sup>Laughlin Library](https://goo.gl/maps/t7GozVngsHs1CfvY8), [The M<sup>c</sup>Laughlin Gallery](http://rmg.on.ca), [Camp Samac](https://goo.gl/maps/Sek5j1rJmY38cARK8),[^1] [M<sup>c</sup>Laughlin Bay](https://www.gm.ca/en/environment/mclaughlin-bay.html), and [Adelaide Ave](https://goo.gl/maps/AbeeAxVxjoDkz7oi7).

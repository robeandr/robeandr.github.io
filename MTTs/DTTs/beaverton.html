<p>Beaverton has a really nice downtown. Along with <a href="brooklin.html">Brooklin</a>, it is my favourite downtown so far.</p>

<p>Started in the mid-1800s by a Scotsman who opened a mill so that farmers wouldn&rsquo;t have to lug their grain all the way to Newmarket, Beaverton really flourished when it became the terminal point for the <strong>Port Hope, Lindsay, and Beaverton Railway</strong> which linked Lake Simcoe in Beaverton with Lake Ontario. At one point, Beaverton had three different kinds of mills and was literally called <em>Mill Town</em> (because that&rsquo;s what it was), before the name Beaverton was chosen. Since then, the railway has been absorbed and the station gone, but Beaverton is still around.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Beaverton&rsquo;s downtown still feels old, but it&rsquo;s really nice. Even though there is a pandemic on, the downtown was lively and felt lived in,<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> which is a quality that I&rsquo;m now noticing other places lack. </p>

<p>Even though the place feels old, it is still well-maintained, and it was delightful strolling up and down the main street (there&rsquo;s only one and it&rsquo;s ironically <em>not</em> actually Main St). They have also done a good job (which <a href="bowmanville">Bowmanville</a> is trying to do) making the street feel integrated as opposed to a moat separating two halves of downtown. The street is narrow and slow/not busy enough that jaywalking<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> is a viable and desirable way to cross the street. In fact, I noticed a distinct lack of crosswalks, probably to encourage safer pedestrian activity.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> It works. </p>

<p>They also have &ldquo;<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPLpsmAbNvJ6BMnDZqccIFkH0oHoWzVyKJJyRW8gcGWVwX964NkJDcCN4TPSRZIA/photo/AF1QipNVIUuJFzNQUN_8ErjJItrUDVxGoshGeycwKewT?key=VVl3OFAwMXpJcEtZdjhnekgwWnU5NHZxQ3dKV2tR">safety sticks</a>&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re called) on the street around downtown to make drivers slow down and think about where they&rsquo;re actually driving through. They work and make the community feel safer. </p>

<p><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPLpsmAbNvJ6BMnDZqccIFkH0oHoWzVyKJJyRW8gcGWVwX964NkJDcCN4TPSRZIA/photo/AF1QipNVIUuJFzNQUN_8ErjJItrUDVxGoshGeycwKewT?key=VVl3OFAwMXpJcEtZdjhnekgwWnU5NHZxQ3dKV2tR"><img src="images/beaverton-sticks.jpg" alt="Sticks in the road on the way to downtown to get drivers to slow."></a></p>

<p>Beaverton downtown has may nice shops to check out, a beautiful park or two, a lovely former town hall, a library, and two pharmacies. The trees and sidewalks provide to a comfortable walking experience, and the locals are friendly. It&rsquo;s definitely a place to visit. </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">&nbsp;The Pier</h2></div>

<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPLpsmAbNvJ6BMnDZqccIFkH0oHoWzVyKJJyRW8gcGWVwX964NkJDcCN4TPSRZIA/photo/AF1QipM9yppYPSu5kOM-SOTeTF6MKgogZxEUNOjZG1R-?key=VVl3OFAwMXpJcEtZdjhnekgwWnU5NHZxQ3dKV2tR"><img src="images/beaverton-pier.jpg" width="400px" alt="Beaverton Pier"></a><p><br>
But that&rsquo;s not all Beaverton has to offer! The <em><a href="http://btehs.com/park-to-pier-discovery-trail/">Park to Pier Discovery Trail</a></em> is definitely a thing to check out. This trail basically covers why Beaverton <em>is</em>. At a little less than 1km long, its not hard to walk (although it is not really accessible as it involves walking on the road and crossing train tracks) and is well-signed. Along the way you get to see the old mill, tracks, and the harbour front, which is absolutely stunning. I think you can see Barrie and Orillia from the pier. I would definitely check this out if I was in the area. </p>

<hr>

<p>Beaverton is a really nice place with grand old buildings, a compact yet &ldquo;useful&rdquo; (for lack of a better word) downtown, and a lovely waterfront. The downtown does an excellent job managing pedestrians and cars, and there are lots of interesting sights to see in the area. Check it out!</p>

<p>Fun Fact: <a href="http://www.thekingshighway.ca/Highway12.htm">King&rsquo;s Highway 12</a> used to pass through Beaverton along Osborne and Simcoe Sts, and Mara Rd (as can be seen in the second map <a href="http://www.thekingshighway.ca/MAPS/Hwy12map.htm">here</a>), but is now only home to the end of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tL1jf7U8eD7vaZEA9">Lake Ridge Rd</a>.

<p>Ironically, crosswalks can <em>decrease</em> pedestrian safety by making people feel like cars will stop for them regardless, whereas without crosswalks, people and drivers check and make eye-contact more often, thus increasing safety. &nbsp;<a href="#fnref4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>

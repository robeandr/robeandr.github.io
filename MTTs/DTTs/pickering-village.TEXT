This is one of the hidden gems of Durham Region. [Pickering Village](https://www.pickeringvillage.ca) was settled uphill from the mill ([again](beaverton.html)) and eventually became a railroad stop ([again](Brooklin.html)), leading to Pickering becoming more popular. Eventually, the entire area became known as Pickering. Later, [Ajax](https://goo.gl/maps/Kviai9GPxgd7TxrR8) was carved out of Pickering, and Pickering Village merged with the Town of Ajax leading to the odd situation nowadays where Pickering Village is not in [Pickering](https://goo.gl/maps/6PDVsb6pfoyUE6nn9). 

But that doesn’t change how lovely this place is and makes it all the more quaint! The “main attraction” of Pickering Village is on Old Kingston Rd, left over from a long-ago diversion to smooth out Highway 2. This creates a little sliver of quiet next to Kingston Rd that isn’t actually all visible from the Highway. In this, Pickering Village manages to pack a lot. 

The village is well-kept and old, but modern at the same time. There’s a collection of fake Tudor houses that encircle a really nice courtyard that jas several shops and restaurants around it; a lovely place to sit on a warm summer’s day. The Tudor style is odd, but still manages to fit in, which is amazing. Other buildings original and not to the village line the street with a wide variety of businesses within. The street is quiet and comfortable for walking on and does a good job managing automobile and foot traffic. The area still feels lively despite this.[^p]

<h1 id="toc_0" style="background-color: #00703c;">302 Baldwin-Brock (<a href="https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/en/about-us/our-services.aspx?_mid_=28171#Frequent">DRT</a>)</h1>

<p>This one is actually in <a href="http://durham.ca">Durham</a>, and runs from the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/iRhH6LTSEA1h8tt36">Whitby GO</a> in the south to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pRUUQfLH32Rcfe1w9">Brooklin</a> in the north. This is an excellent way to see the town of Whitby (and for more of Durham, I would recommend the <a href="https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php/DRT_Pulse">900 PULSE</a>). </p>

<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DPsvxK8bjYTyLrr49"><img src="images/Baldwin407.jpg" alt="Sign on exit to Baldwin St from 407 showing Highway 12 to the south and north." width=400px></a></p>

<p>The 302 travels along Brock St/Baldwin St for most of its route (obviously) and takes riders through the centre of Whitby, passing Rotary Park, the Four Corners in downtown, and then up north through the fields that separate Whitby and Brooklin to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DJo7qoHyeZsR3uxcA">Brooklin</a> itself.</p>

<p>Riders will get to see the various different &ldquo;types&rdquo; of Whitby, from the quieter older neighbourhoods just north of the 401, to the historic downtown, to the newer subdivisions in the north. </p>

<p>North of Taunton, Brock St changes to Baldwin St and the route passes by some of the newest neighbourhoods in Whitby before going through the fields that separate the town from the village of Brooklin. </p>

<p>In between, we have the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DPsvxK8bjYTyLrr49">new 407</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t really feel too out of place in a space such as this. </p>

<p>Finally, the route terminates in Brooklin: doing a loop around downtown before hading back south again. Brooklin is very nice, and the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ARcwJMFZ5Rqbdinv8">Baldwin &amp; Winchester</a> area (esp. to the north) has some nice shops and streets to walk on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is also a great place to get the 52 GO Bus to North York, which runs along Highway 7 (Winchester) along here. To the east of Baldwin are a few GO stops that have nice trees to wait under and a wide sidewalk to stand on, with great visibility. There&rsquo;s also a creek and a skating rink that has GO parking if that&rsquo;s of interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, route 302 is an excellent connecting route from the Town of Whitby, with a good variety of &ldquo;Whitby-ness&rdquo; along the way. The buses are frequent, and despite stopping often, I have found the schedule to be quite reliable. A great way to see Whitby or go north. </p>

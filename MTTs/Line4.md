# Line 4
### Adorable
![Toronto's adorable little stubway.](Images/4/Stubway.jpeg)

Line 4 is probably Toronto’s most adorable piece of overkill. The stations are bright and airy, the line is remote, and I’m sure it’s useful to someone, but it just feels so *excessive*. And short. 

The entire line is very **pink**. All stations on this line have pink accents with a beige or grey background that combine to give the entire line a very sterilized, pink aura. This contrasts with, say, the [Bloor-Danforth](Line2.html) line where each station has its own scheme. An excellent place to see this is the lonesome Don Mills, which is absolutely cavernous, pink, and lonely feeling. 

Line 4 is short, adorable, and relatively quiet; but the stations are lonesome and uninspired, and the line is infested with the terribly inconsistent Sheppard signage (obviously). There’s not much to recommend in this, but it’s a fun, albeit short, subway ride.

I envision a future centred around public transportation and community. Will this require a major cultural shift? Yes. Will this take decades? Yes. Let me explain. 

Current North American society is built around the car and individual independent life. Unfortunately, this leads to untenable situations like the 401 over Toronto in the morning. Public transportation is the only way to dig ourselves out of the car hole we've put ourselves in. 

Current norms will lead to more and more cars on the roads, and waiting around for self-driving cars to fix everything is definitely a mistake (if they'll even be affordable at first, which is unlikely). In the meantime (and for the future), we should embrace public transportation as the "great leveller". 

For this to work, investment in public transit is required, as is making sure new developments take transit and local travel into account. Transit needs to be quick and convenient, with an ease of use comparable to that of the car.

### Learning Philosophy

### Values
> From the "Values Assessment":

Work Values (In priority order) | Lifestyle Values (In priority order)
------------ | -------------
Be supervised by a supervisor/boss who I like | Stay at home on weekends
Work with supportive co-workers | Have opportunities to get involved in your community
Combination of indoors and outdoors | Live close to cultural and entertainment opportunities
Work in an urban/suburban setting | Live close to stores
Not having to work in evenings or weekends | Live where your spouse can have  a good job
Significant local travel is required | Go places on weekends
Help people who have needs | Have friends nearby
Engage in intellectually stimulating tasks | Have time to pursue your interests
A regular shift of 8 hours per day/set schedule | Live in a stable neighbourhood
Little or no pressure | Do things often with friends

1. Compare your work values and lifestyle values to identify conflicts and compatibility. For example, do you want to earn a high salary but also have a lot of time for leisure pursuits? (Sometimes these can be at odds)
> Fortuitously, my work values are compatible with my lifestyle values (at least the ones I can control). 

2. Are there values that are not listed above that should be included?
> - Close to healthcare
> - Easy access to public transit
> - Good walkability
> - Close-ish to work (20mins)[^1]
> - Limited uncompensated work

### Personality

[^1]: In a fascinating book I read, _Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do_, it was stated that the best commute is actually 18min, not less. It gives the mind time to context-switch.

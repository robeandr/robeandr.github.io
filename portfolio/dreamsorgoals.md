# Dreams and Goals

> “If you trust in yourself… and believe in your dreams… and follow your star… you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.”

### Childhood
I've always wanted to be an engineer, and have always been fascinated with transportation. Below, you can explore the evolution of Lego City, which was once sprawled across my basement.

### Why Geomatics?
I like maps. And I like transportation. The two go together, which in high school led to me taking all three available years of Geography: Canada, Europe and Asia, and Natural Disasters. Towards the end of high school, I started looking at civil engineering programs in Ontario as that’s what I wanted to do. However, the York University website included an article on “Geomatics Engineering” which combined geography, technology, and engineering: three of my biggest interests. So, off I went to Toronto!

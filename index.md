## What this is
Welcome to my (third) homepage! This is a place I do things on the web. 

As this is my third edition of my website, things are a bit scattered, but I've tried to keep everything together. Take a look at:

- [GIS Website Demo](demo/index.html)
	- This was the first edition of this website created to show some basic HTML, CSS, and (ew) JavaScript. It is entirely hand-written
- [Co-Op Portfolio](portfolio/index.html)
	- This I despise and is the second edition of this website created to showcase myself for an introduction to the workforce course in Co-Op. (I had a much better time actually working.)
- [*MTT*](MTT.html)
	- This is the third (and current) edition of this website where I do transit line reviews! Because sometimes getting there is the trip.

## Colophon
This is currently held together with a mess of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)[^m] files and html edited in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) with CSS in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)[^b], managed through the [Finder](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/) and published by [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com). Someday I may take the time to do this right. 

Body text is (ideally) in [Verdana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdana), with headings in [IBM Plex Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ibm-plex) or [Gill Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans).
